# AMELIA

## Description

Amelia is a challenge consisting of three classification tasks in the context of argument
mining in the legal domain. The tasks are based on a
dataset of 225 Italian decisions on Value Added Tax, an-
notated to identify and categorize argumentative text.
The objective of the first task is to classify each argumentative component as a premise or conclusion. In contrast,
the second and third tasks aim at classifying the type of
premise: legal vs factual, and its corresponding argumen-
tation scheme. The classes are highly unbalanced, hence
evaluation is based on the macro F1 score.
