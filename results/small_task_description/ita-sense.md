# ITA-SENSE

## Description

Ita-Sense is a task that assesses LLMs’ abilities in understanding lexical semantics through Word Sense Disambiguation. The classical Word Sense Disambiguation task is cast as a generative problem formalized as two tasks: [T1] Given a target word and a sentence in which the word occurs, generate the correct meaning definition; [T2] Given a target word and a sentence in which the word occurs, choose the correct meaning definition from a predefined set. For CALAMITA, LLMs are tested in a zero-shot setting
