## Description

Geese is focused on evaluating the impact of generated explanations on the predictive performance of language models for the task of Recognizing Textual Entailment in Italian. Using a dataset enriched with human-written explanations, two large language models are employed to generate and utilize ex planations for semantic relationships between sentence pairs. GEESE assesses the quality of generated explanations by measuring changes in prediction accuracy when explanations are provided.
