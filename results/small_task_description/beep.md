# BEEP

## Description

Beep is a benchmark to evaluate large language models in the con-
text of a simulated Italian driver’s license exam. This chal-
lenge tests the models’ ability to understand and apply
traffic laws, road safety regulations, and vehicle-related
knowledge through a series of true/false questions. The
dataset is derived from official ministerial materials used
in the Italian licensing process, explicitly targeting Cate-
gory B licenses.
