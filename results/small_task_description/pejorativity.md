## Description

PejorativITy is a task to investigate misogyny expressed through neutral words that can assume a negative connotation when functioning as pejorative epithets. This challenge addresses a) the disambiguation of such ambiguous words in a given context; b) the detection of misogyny in instances that contain such polysemic words. The task is divided into two parts, both framed as a binary classification. In Task A, the model is asked to define if, given a tweet, the target word is used in a pejorative or non-pejorative way. In Task B, the model is asked whether the whole sentence is misogynous.
