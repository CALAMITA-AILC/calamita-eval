## Description

Macid is a task aimed at evaluating LLMs to differentiate be tween closely related action concepts based on textual descriptions alone. The challenge is inspired by the ”find the intruder” task, where models must identify an out- lier among a set of 4 sentences that describe similar yet distinct actions. The dataset highlights action-predicate mismatches, where the same verb may describe different actions, or different verbs may refer to the same action. Although mono-modal (text-only), the task is designed for future multimodal integration, linking visual and textual representations to enhance action recognition.
