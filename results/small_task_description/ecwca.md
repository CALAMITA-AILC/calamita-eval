# ECWCA

## Description

ECWCA is designed to evaluate the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs through crossword clue-answering. The challenge consists of two tasks: a standard question-answering format where the LLM is asked to solve crossword clues and a variation where the model is given hints about the word lengths of the answers, which is expected to help models with reasoning abilities.
