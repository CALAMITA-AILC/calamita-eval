## Description

BLM-It is a task made of linguistic puzzles (matrices) around language-
related problems, focusing on formal and semantic prop-
erties of language. A BLM matrix consists of a context
set and an answer set. The context is a sequence of sen-
tences that encodes implicitly an underlying generative
linguistic rule. The contrastive multiple-choice answer
set includes negative examples following corrupted gen-
erating rules. The models are prompted in a few-shot
setting. The datasets comprise a few prompts for a few-
shot setting.
