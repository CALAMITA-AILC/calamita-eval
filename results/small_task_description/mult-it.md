# Mult-IT

## Description

Mult-IT is a large-scale Multi-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) dataset for evaluating the factual knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs in Italian. This contribution aims to counteract the disadvantages of using MCQA benchmarks that are automatically translated from English and may sound unnatural, contain errors, or use linguistics constructions that do not align with the target language. In addition, they may introduce topical and ideological biases reflecting Anglo-centric perspectives. Mult-IT comprises over 110,000 manually written questions sourced directly from preparation quizzes for Italian university entrance exams or for exams for public sector employment in Italy.
