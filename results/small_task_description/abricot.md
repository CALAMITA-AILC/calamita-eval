## Description

Abricot is a task designed to evaluate Italian language
models on their ability to understand and assess the ab-
stractness and inclusiveness of language, two nuanced
features that humans naturally convey in everyday com-
munication. Unlike binary categorizations such as ab-
stract/concrete or inclusive/exclusive, these features exist
on a continuous spectrum with varying degrees of inten-
sity. The task is based on a manual collection of sentences
that present the same noun phrase (NP) in different con-
texts, allowing its interpretation to vary between the
extremes of abstractness and inclusiveness. This chal-
lenge aims to verify how LLMs perceive subtle linguistic
variations and their implications in natural language.
