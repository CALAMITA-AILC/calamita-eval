## Description

EurekaRebus is a task that tests the ability of LLMs to conduct multi-step, knowledge-intensive inferences while respecting predefined constraints. LLMs are prompted to reason step-by-step to solve verbalized variants of rebus games. Verbalized rebuses replace visual cues with crossword definitions to create an encrypted first pass, making the problem entirely text-based.
Multiple metrics are used to grasp the models’ performance in knowledge recall, constraints adherence, and re-segmentation abilities across reasoning steps.
