## Description

DIMMI is a task aimed at evaluating the proficiency of Large Language Models in extracting drug-specific information from Patient Information Leaflets. The challenge evaluates the effectiveness of processing complex medical information in Italian and is approached as an information extraction task in a zero-shot setting, based on the model’s pre-existing knowledge or through in-context learning. Evaluation is performed against a manually created gold standard.
