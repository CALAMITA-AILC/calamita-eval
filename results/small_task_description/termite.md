## Description

Termite focuses on the Text-to-SQL task in Italian. Natural language queries are written natively in Italian, and the models are expected to turn them into SQL queries. The dataset is built to be invisible to search engines since it is locked under an encryption key delivered along the resource to reduce accidental inclusion in upcoming training sets. It contains hand-crafted databases in different domains, each with a balanced set of NL-SQL query pairs. The NL questions are built in such a way that they can be solved by a model relying only on its linguistic proficiency and an analysis of the schema, with no external knowledge needed.
