# VeryfIT

## Description

VerifyIT is designed to evaluate the in-memory factual knowledge of language models on data written by professional fact-checkers, posing it as a true or false question. Topics of the statements vary, but most are in specific domains related to the Italian government, policies, and social issues. The task presents several challenges: extracting statements from segments of speeches, determining appropriate contextual relevance both temporally and factually, and verifying the statements’ accuracy.
