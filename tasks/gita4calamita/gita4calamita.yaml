# this tasks NEED to be run in the following order:
# story_class
# conflict_detect
# physical_state
# the first two subclass will produce a .json file
# it's FUNDAMENTAL for the next subtasks.
# can be safely deleted after completition of all tasks
# P.S. the files could be made more unique adding the PID
# of the evaluation process, as to make possible parallel
# evaluations. As of now, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DO PARALLEL
# EVALUATIONS as they would overwrite each others files.
